My very FIRST long term coding project.


No really, this is my FIRST long term coding project! Originally created in windows batch, and still mostly in windows batch, this son of a bitch is packed to the brim with "chinglish" esqe spelling mistakes, poor coding practices, and random miscellaneous files that I've long since forgotten the purpose of.

I made this back when I was about 8 or 9 on my mom's old Dell Inspiron 1501 with 1GiB of ram and an Athlon 64 x2. God I miss that machine...

I got into coding after stumbling across video tutorials on youtube about windows batch script. I must have been REALLY interested because I would actually invest the time into manually typing those batch files into that laptop from whatever youtube video I was on. 

Not _that_ much different from you boomers out there that typed basic programs into a Commodore VIC-20 from a magazine, manual, or whatever.

I would eventually dabble in vbs and html/js. All of this crap under Windows Vista (and a dead ram stick, so the machine would quite often crash/lockup in creative manners. Very few bluescreens though!)

I have long since lost interested in this project, with last modified dates on files dating all the way back to 2014, with the oldest one being from 02/04/2014 at 16:27.

This isn't my first coding project though. A notable specimen created before this being a really REALLY crappy text """"adventure"""" game that was more linear then linear. You HAD to type the exact thing to progress, there was only one path!

That, however, has long since been lost to the sand of time. I remember a copy being in an archived zip file that I forgot the password to and ended up deleting.
